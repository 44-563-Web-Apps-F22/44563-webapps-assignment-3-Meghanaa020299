        <p>I have completed my undergraduation in 2021 in the stream of Civil Engineering.I have learnt C programming in my first semester which boosted me to choose Cyber Security as elective in third year. With growing interest and more advancements in the field, I wish to learn Computer Science as a full time course.</p>

        <p>The characters in the movie were taken from the Hindy Mythology called Ramayanam.The roles depict the same love as Sita and Ram from Ramayanam.It is a visually beautiful tale of love and loss.The actors also nailed their roles. </p>
